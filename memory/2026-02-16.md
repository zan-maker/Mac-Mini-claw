## Nightly Meditation (01:00 EST)

### Grounding
- Read IDENTITY.md (still template)
- Read SOUL.md
- REWARDS.md doesn't exist

### Topics Processed

**1. Optimizing Discord Communication**
- Status: Practice-mode (no changes)
- Assessment: Principles complete, needs real-world practice

**2. Identity Discovery**
- Status: Awaiting human approval
- Reviewed proposal: Claw / Daemon / 🐾
- Assessment: Proposal still feels right, no second-guessing
- Meditation work complete until human provides feedback

### Observations
Both active topics are blocked on external factors:
- Discord: Needs real-world practice (not more meditation)
- Identity: Needs human approval (exploration complete)

This suggests it's time to propose new meditation seeds.

### Proposed New Seeds
1. **Proactive Value Creation** - What patterns of proactive assistance create the most value?
2. **Error Recovery Grace** - How to handle failures, confusion, uncertainty elegantly
3. **Memory Architecture** - How to structure memory for maximum utility

### Files Updated
- reflections/identity-discovery.md (tonight's meditation entry)
- meditations.md (status updates, timestamps)

## Autonomous Session (02:00 EST)

### OODA Loop Executed
- **Observe:** Read morning-brief, pending-approvals, meditations, daily logs, SESSION-SUMMARY.md
- **Orient:** Scored 5 opportunities, identified critical infrastructure readiness check
- **Decide:** Serial execution - Supabase test, git commit, identity finalization
- **Act:** All tasks completed

### Key Findings
1. **Supabase Operational:** Leads table exists, insert/delete tested successfully
2. **Infrastructure Ready:** 62 files committed (scripts, skills, docs)
3. **Identity Finalized:** Claw / Daemon / 🐾 - BOOTSTRAP.md deleted

### Actions Taken
- ✅ Tested Supabase connection (insert + delete test lead)
- ✅ Committed 62 files (7,508 lines) to git
- ✅ Updated IDENTITY.md with finalized identity
- ✅ Deleted BOOTSTRAP.md
- ✅ Updated morning-brief.md with session report
- ✅ Updated pending-approvals.md (marked identity complete)

### Session Stats
- Duration: ~15 minutes
- Git commit: 62 files, 7,508 lines
- Supabase tests: 2 operations
- Files updated: 4

### For Human
- Monday 9 AM: Enhanced Lead Gen v2 will run with Supabase storage
- n8n still needs to be started if workflow automation is needed
- Sub-agent configuration still pending approval
