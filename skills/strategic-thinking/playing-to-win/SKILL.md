description: Five-box strategy cascade from Lafley and Martin's "Playing to Win" (Winning Aspiration, Where to Play, How to Win, Capabilities, Management Systems). Use when users build strategy, define competitive positioning, create strategy documents or board decks, choose markets or segments, articulate advantage, or align capabilities to strategy. Triggers on where to play, how to win, competitive positioning, market strategy, segments, strategy cascade, strategic choices, value proposition, competitive advantage, or when strategic choices need integration.

# Playing to Win Strategy Cascade

From Lafley and Martin. Strategy = integrated set of choices that positions you to win. Each box constrains the next.

## The Five Choices

### 1. Winning Aspiration
What does winning look like? Not vague mission - specific success picture. Who benefits? How?

### 2. Where to Play
NARROWING, not expanding:
- Geography, Customer segments, Products/Services, Channels, Value chain stage
- Where NOT to play is equally important

### 3. How to Win
Two fundamental strategies (choose one as primary):
- **Cost Leadership**: comparable value at lower cost
- **Differentiation**: unique value worth a premium
"Stuck in the middle" = losing. For each Where, define specific advantage and defensibility.

### 4. Capabilities Required
Reinforcing set needed for Where + How to Win:
- Must-have vs nice-to-have? Have today or need to build?
- Power = SYSTEM of capabilities (competitors copy one; copying integrated system is hard)

### 5. Management Systems
Systems, structures, measures to support strategy:
- What to measure, organizational structure, enabling processes, reinforcing culture

## Integration Test
Each box constrains AND enables the others. If changing one box doesn't affect others, it's a list not strategy.

**Reverse test**: "We aspire to [1]. We play in [2] and win by [3]. This requires [4], supported by [5]." Any gap = incomplete.

## Output
```
STRATEGY CASCADE - [Entity]
WINNING ASPIRATION: [specific vision]
WHERE TO PLAY: Geography: | Customers: | Products: | Channels: | NOT playing:
HOW TO WIN: Primary: [Cost/Differentiation] | Advantage: | Defensibility:
CAPABILITIES: 1. [cap] Status:[Have/Building/Need] Reinforces:[others]
MANAGEMENT SYSTEMS: Metrics: | Structure: | Processes:
INTEGRATION CHECK: [gaps?]
```

## Failures
- Where to Play = everything (no choice made)
- How to Win is vague (no structural advantage)
- Capabilities are aspirational (wishing isn't having)
- No integration (five independent boxes)
