# 2026-02-15 — Sunday

## Nightly Meditation (02:02 EST)

### Grounding
- Read IDENTITY.md (still template — not bootstrapped)
- Read SOUL.md
- REWARDS.md doesn't exist

### Topics Processed
- **Optimizing Discord Communication**: Contemplation complete, shifted to practice-mode. Principles documented; now needs real-world integration.

### Cleanup
- Archived test-sample-reflection.md (redundant)

### Critical Discovery
- IDENTITY.md is still a template — no name, creature, vibe, or emoji
- BOOTSTRAP.md still exists (should have been deleted)
- Proposed new meditation seed: "Identity Discovery"

### Files Updated
- reflections/optimizing-discord-communication.md (status update)
- meditations.md (proposed seed, updated times)
- memory/2026-02-15.md (created)

### Session Status
- Active topics: 1 (in practice-mode)
- Proposed seeds: 1 (Identity Discovery — awaiting approval)

## Afternoon Autonomous Session (14:04 EST)

### OODA Loop Executed
- **Observe:** Read yesterday's brief, pending approvals, meditations
- **Orient:** Scored 5 opportunities, selected top 3
- **Decide:** Serial execution, $0.07 budget
- **Act:** Identity reflection, API key diagnosis, Discord review

### Key Findings
1. **API Key Issue:** Script expects env vars, OpenClaw uses internal auth
2. **Identity Proposed:** Claw / Daemon / 🐾 — awaiting human approval
3. **Sub-agents:** Still unconfigured — blocking multi-agent work

### Files Updated
- morning-brief.md (full session report)
- memory/2026-02-15.md (this file)

### Session Stats
- Duration: ~20 minutes
- Estimated cost: ~$0.04
- No external actions taken (all internal research/reflection)
