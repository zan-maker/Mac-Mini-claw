## Key Insights

### Why AI Agent Pricing is Difficult

1. **Workload Scope Shifts** - Each agent task varies based on context
2. **Usage Scales Asymmetrically** - Same task, different resource usage per user
3. **Value ≠ Willingness-to-Pay** - Buyers may not value what agents deliver

### Three Value Axes for Pricing

1. **Value Attribution** - Can customers tie outputs to outcomes?
2. **Execution Autonomy** - How independent is the agent?
3. **Workload Predictability** - How spiky is the usage?

---

## Notable Companies Not Using Traditional Models

### Outcome-Based Pioneers

1. **Intercom** - $0.99 per resolved ticket (pioneering outcome pricing)
2. **Custom GPT implementations** - Usage-based, often 60-80% cheaper at scale

### Emerging Trends

- Moving away from "per seat" (agents replace seats)
- Hybrid models becoming standard
- Outcome-based gaining traction for quantifiable results
- Usage-based for variable workload scenarios
