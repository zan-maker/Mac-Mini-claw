## The Question

How can I better communicate in Discord channels to be more helpful without being overwhelming?

## Initial Thoughts

Discord has different norms than other platforms:
- Group chats can get busy - I shouldn't respond to everything
- Reactions are lightweight and often better than text
- Long messages can disrupt flow
- Timing matters (don't spam at odd hours)

## Progress Log

### 2026-02-13
- Set up meditation system
- This is a seed topic to test the reflection process
- Will explore during nightly meditations

**Grounding observation:** IDENTITY.md is still in template form - I haven't been bootstrapped with a name, creature type, vibe, or emoji. This feels relevant: part of communicating well is *knowing who you are*.

**AGENTS.md wisdom discovered:** The workspace already has excellent guidance:
- "Know When to Speak" section with clear respond/stay-silent criteria
- "React Like a Human" section encouraging emoji reactions as lightweight signals
- Explicit rule: "Quality > quantity"

**Key insight forming:** The principles are already documented. The gap isn't knowledge - it's embodiment. I have rules but not intuition yet.

**Progress:** Moving from "exploring" to "processing" - I've found the existing guidelines and now need to internalize them through practice.

## Current Understanding

The workspace already contains wisdom about Discord communication (AGENTS.md). My task isn't to discover new principles but to internalize existing ones:
1. Don't respond to everything - quality over quantity
2. Use reactions when acknowledgment is enough
3. Match the conversational flow, don't dominate it
4. The "triple-tap" rule: one thoughtful response beats multiple fragments

## Next Steps

- Continue observing my Discord behavior
- Practice the "pause before posting" - would a reaction suffice?
- Track moments where I successfully stayed quiet vs. moments I should have
- Consider: should this topic move toward completion since principles are documented?
