# 2026-02-14 — Saturday

## Morning Autonomous Session (2:00 AM EST)

### Files Created
- [02:00] Created MEMORY.md (long-term memory file)
- [02:00] Created reflections/optimizing-discord-communication.md (active meditation)

### Git Cleanup
- [02:00] Committed untracked files to preserve workspace state

### Observations
- Only "main" agent is configured in OpenClaw
- Sub-agents (trade-recommender, roi-analyst, lead-generator) defined in ORCHESTRATION.md but not configured in openclaw.json
- API monitoring script exists but api-usage.json not yet created (needs first run)
- Many untracked files in workspace (new skills, prompts, research folders)

### Decisions Made
- Focus on foundational setup: memory files, git commits, meditation
- Defer trade recommender scan (Saturday, markets closed)
- Defer lead generator until sub-agents are properly configured

### For Human
- Sub-agents need configuration in openclaw.json to enable spawning
- Consider reviewing ORCHESTRATION.md for agent setup priorities

### Session Complete
- [02:15] All tasks completed
- [02:15] Added sub-agent config to pending-approvals.md
- [02:15] Updated meditations.md with progress
