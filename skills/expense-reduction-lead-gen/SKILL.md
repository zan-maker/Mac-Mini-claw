## Outreach Sequence

### Day 1: Initial Email
**Subject:** Reduce [Company Name]'s OPEX by 15-30% with success-based pricing

Hi [First Name],

I noticed [Company Name] is at a growth stage where expense management becomes critical to margins. Most companies your size are overspending on SaaS, telecom, and vendor contracts—but lack the bandwidth to continuously optimize.

We offer a technology-led expense reduction service that:
- Identifies savings across OPEX categories (SaaS, telecom, logistics, vendors)
- Uses automation to continuously surface opportunities
- Charges success fees ONLY on verified savings you can see in your own financials

If we don't deliver savings, you pay only a modest admin fee. No risk.

Organizations typically see 15-30% OPEX reduction within 6 months.

Worth a 15-minute call to see what this could look like for [Company Name]?

Best,
Zander

### Day 4: Follow-up #1
**Subject:** Re: OPEX reduction for [Company Name]

Hi [First Name],

Quick follow-up on expense reduction.

Most CFOs we talk to are spending 10-20 hours per month on vendor reviews, contract renewals, and spend analysis—tasks that are important but don't scale.

Our automation handles the heavy lifting:
- Continuous monitoring of spend patterns
- Automated identification of savings opportunities
- Clear reporting on what's been saved (in your numbers, not ours)

The model is simple: modest admin fee + success fees only on verified savings.

Open to a quick call to see the math?

Best,
Zander

### Day 7: Follow-up #2
**Subject:** [Company Name] expense reduction - one quick question

Hi [First Name],

One question: if we could reduce your OPEX by 15-30% and you only paid when you saw the savings in your own financials, would that be worth exploring?

If yes, let's chat.

If no timing-wise, I'll stop reaching out.

Best,
Zander

### Day 14: Break-up
**Subject:** Last note: [Company Name] expense reduction

Hi [First Name],

I'll stop reaching out after this, but wanted to leave the door open.

If OPEX becomes a focus area down the road—whether it's SaaS creep, vendor renegotiations, or travel policy—our model is worth a look. Technology-led, success-based, zero risk.

Here if you need it.

Best,
Zander
