### 3.5 Management, Brand & Structural Options

- Brand: Thesis is a proprietary, non-franchised **brand**, with no legacy chain affiliation.  
- Management:  
  - HMA with Hersha for back-of-house operations; agreement is terminable at any time without penalty, allowing for re-flagging or internalization of management.  
- Structuring options:  
  1. Hotel only: Seller can separate the hotel and transact on just the hotel component.  
  2. Mixed-use hold: Acquire entire mixed-use (hotel + multifamily + retail) and operate as a campus-style asset.  
  3. Residential densification / conversion:  
     - Zoning allows additional residential density; up to 144 of 245 hotel keys can be converted to multifamily units with full kitchens.  
     - Alternatively, potential to convert all 245 hotel keys to student housing if no more than 144 units are fitted with full kitchens (kitchens drive the “dwelling unit” classification).  
     - This creates a potential student-housing/dorm model fully tied into University of Miami demand.

## 4. High-Level Investment Themes

### 4.1 Tides South Beach / Tides Village

- Trophy oceanfront positioning with grandfathered beach service rights and large all-suite room product. [file:1]  
- Under-branded relative to comp set ADR, suggesting upside via branding/asset management and F&B performance optimization. [file:1]  
- Expansion via Tides Village offers scale (95 additional keys) and incremental F&B/retail and amenities, enhancing exit profile and operating leverage. [file:1]  

### 4.2 Thesis Hotel Miami

- Institutional-scale, mixed-use hospitality plus multifamily asset directly adjacent to major demand driver (University of Miami).  
- NOI of ~18.1M supports current income with upside from:  
  - Lease-up of remaining retail buildouts and rent growth.  
  - Repositioning of hotel branding/management.  
  - Long-term densification/student-housing conversion.  
- Flexible capital structure via assumable fixed-rate debt (~150M, 4.65%) and potential to carve out components (hotel vs. multifamily/retail).
