# Blue Ocean Strategy

From Kim and Mauborgne. Best strategy isn't beating competitors - it's making them irrelevant.

## Red vs Blue

| Red Ocean | Blue Ocean |
|---|---|
| Compete in existing space | Create uncontested space |
| Beat competition | Make competition irrelevant |
| Value-cost tradeoff | Break value-cost tradeoff |
| Differentiation OR cost | Differentiation AND cost |

## Tool 1: Strategy Canvas
X-axis: factors industry competes on. Y-axis: offering level (H/M/L).
Plot you + competitors. Look for convergence (commodity), overinvestment, gaps.
Blue Ocean = DIFFERENT shaped curve, not higher on same factors.

## Tool 2: Four Actions (ERRC)
**ELIMINATE**: Factors taken for granted to remove entirely
**REDUCE**: Drop well below standard where over-delivering
**RAISE**: Increase above standard where buyers compromise
**CREATE**: New factors never offered

Power = combination: cut cost (E/R) while increasing value (R/C).

## Tool 3: Buyer Utility Map
Stages: Purchase | Delivery | Use | Supplements | Maintenance | Disposal
Levers: Productivity | Simplicity | Convenience | Risk | Fun | Environmental
Each cell = potential opportunity. Ignored cells = best opportunities.

## Tool 4: Three Tiers of Non-Customers
Tier 1: On the edge, minimally using. Why minimal?
Tier 2: Consciously refused. What caused rejection?
Tier 3: Never considered industry. What assumptions block reach?

## Tool 5: Price Corridor
1. Find mass buyer price band (across substitutes)
2. Set price by defensibility
3. Work backward to cost targets

## Output
