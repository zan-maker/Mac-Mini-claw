Subject: Multi-generational wellness asset in Costa Rica's Blue Zone
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=utf-8

Dear Mr. Dziminski,

I'm reaching out regarding Dorada, a first-of-its-kind regenerative destination resort and residential community in one of the world's rare Blue Zone regions of Costa Rica.

Given The Rosewood Corp's focus on wellness, healthcare, and family-owned enterprises, I believe Dorada aligns with your investment philosophy—particularly as a multi-generational legacy asset that combines:

- 300-acre protected bio-reserve with panoramic ocean views
- 40 private estate homes (1+ acre lots)
- Longevity & Human Performance Center offering personalized healthspan programs
- Fully off-grid with sustainable infrastructure
- Recurring revenue from wellness programs and memberships

Dorada is the vision of Dr. Vincent Giampapa, a globally recognized leader in anti-aging medicine and regenerative science. It's designed not as a hospitality project, but as a permanent wellness ecosystem for long-term ownership.

Why for family offices: Capital preservation with upside, intergenerational relevance, personal use optionality, and alignment with the $2.1T wellness economy (12.4% CAGR).

Would you be open to a brief call to discuss the opportunity? I'd be happy to share the full investor deck.

Best,

Sam Desigan
