# Expense Reduction Lead Gen - Scrapling-First Enhanced

## 🚀 NEW: Scrapling Integration Activated

**Scrapling gives us an unfair advantage:**
- **774x faster** than traditional web scraping
- **Cloudflare bypass** - automatically handles anti-bot systems
- **Maximum stealth** - no bot detection
- **Adaptive scraping** - no selector maintenance needed
- **AI-powered extraction** - natural language queries

## 📋 Your Task (Scrapling-First Approach)

### Step 1: Try Scrapling First (Primary Source)
```python
# Use Scrapling integration for fast, reliable data extraction
# Scrapling is installed in: /Users/cubiczan/.openclaw/workspace/scrapling-integration/
# Activate virtual environment: source /Users/cubiczan/.openclaw/workspace/scrapling-venv/bin/activate

import sys
sys.path.insert(0, '/Users/cubiczan/.openclaw/workspace/scrapling-integration')

try:
    from cron_integration import ScraplingCronIntegration
    
    async def run_with_scrapling():
        # Initialize Scrapling with stealth mode
        scrapling = ScraplingCronIntegration(stealth_mode=True)
        success = await scrapling.initialize()
        
        if success:
            print("✅ Scrapling initialized successfully")
            # Use Scrapling for data extraction
            # [Job-specific Scrapling code will go here]
            results = await scrapling.generate_expense_reduction_leads()
            return results
        else:
            print("⚠️ Scrapling initialization failed, falling back to traditional APIs")
            return []
except ImportError:
    print("⚠️ Scrapling not available, using traditional APIs")
```

### Step 2: Fall Back to Traditional APIs (If Scrapling Fails)
If Scrapling returns no results or fails:
1. **First fallback:** Use **Tavily API** (preferred)
   - API Key: `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`
   - Faster and more reliable than Brave Search

2. **Second fallback:** Use **Brave Search API**
   - API Key: `cac43a248afb1cc1ec004370df2e0282a67eb420`
   - Use only if Tavily fails

### Step 3: Process and Report Results
1. Process the data (same as before)
2. Save results to appropriate files
3. **IMPORTANT:** Include Scrapling usage status in Discord report:
   ```
   🔍 **Data Source Report:**
   - Scrapling Used: ✅ Yes / ❌ No
   - Scrapling Results: X leads
   - Traditional API Results: Y leads
   - Total Processing Time: Z seconds
   ```

## 🎯 Performance Benefits
- **Speed:** 774x faster than BeautifulSoup
- **Reliability:** Bypasses Cloudflare and anti-bot systems
- **Stealth:** No bot detection
- **Maintenance:** Zero selector maintenance
- **Cost:** Reduces API calls to Serper/Tavily

## 📊 Report Format
Always include Scrapling status in your Discord report.
