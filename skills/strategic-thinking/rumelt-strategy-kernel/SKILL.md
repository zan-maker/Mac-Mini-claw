description: Strategy evaluation and formulation framework based on Richard Rumelt's "Good Strategy Bad Strategy" kernel structure (Diagnosis, Guiding Policy, Coherent Actions). Use when users need to evaluate whether a strategy is real or fluff, formulate a strategy from a messy situation, critique a strategic plan, write a strategy document, prepare a board deck with strategic framing, or distinguish between goals and actual strategy. Triggers on strategy, strategic plan, competitive advantage, strategic direction, is this a good strategy, strategy review, strategic priorities, or when a plan conflates goals with strategy.

# Rumelt Strategy Kernel

Evaluate and formulate strategy using Richard Rumelt's kernel framework. Core insight: most strategies are just goals, wishlists, or slogans. Real strategy has three parts that form a coherent whole.

## The Strategy Kernel

**1. Diagnosis** - What's going on here?
Clear, honest statement of the challenge. Simplifies reality by identifying critical factors. Names the problem.

Forcing questions:
- What is the single most critical challenge?
- What makes this hard?
- What have we been ignoring?
- Which one problem unlocks the rest?

**2. Guiding Policy** - What's our approach?
NOT a goal - a method. Channels action by ruling things out. Creates advantage through focus.

Forcing questions:
- Does this rule things out?
- Does this explain HOW?
- Would a competitor choose differently?
- Does this create focus or please everyone?

**3. Coherent Actions** - What specifically will we do?
Coordinated, feasible actions that reinforce each other. Resource allocation must match.

Forcing questions:
- Do actions reinforce each other?
- Are they feasible given actual capabilities?
- Do they follow from the guiding policy?
- What must we STOP doing?

## Bad Strategy Detection

Flag any of four hallmarks:

**Fluff** - Buzzword inflation that says nothing.
**Failure to face the challenge** - No acknowledgment of the actual problem.
**Mistaking goals for strategy** - Goals without HOW.
**Bad strategic objectives** - Disconnected wish lists, no prioritization.

## Execution Modes

### Mode 1: Strategy Evaluation
1. Extract the kernel (often one or more elements are missing)
2. Apply bad strategy tests
3. Score each element on specificity, honesty, coherence
4. Deliver verdict directly - if bad, say so and offer to reformulate

### Mode 2: Strategy Formulation
1. Start with diagnosis - probe for the real challenge (most time here)
2. Derive guiding policy - test against "does this rule things out?"
3. Design coherent actions - check resource conflicts, mutual reinforcement
4. Stress test through the bad strategy detector

### Mode 3: Strategy-on-a-Page
```
STRATEGY KERNEL

DIAGNOSIS
[2-3 sentences naming the core challenge]

GUIDING POLICY
[1-2 sentences: what we will and won't do]

COHERENT ACTIONS
1. [Action] - [How it supports the guiding policy]
2. [Action] - [How it supports the guiding policy]
3. [Action] - [How it supports the guiding policy]

WHAT WE'RE STOPPING
- [Activity conflicting with the guiding policy]
```

## Sources of Power
- Leverage: effort where it has greatest effect
- Proximate objectives: achievable goals that clear the fog
- Chain-link systems: performance limited by weakest link
- Design: tight integration where whole exceeds parts
- Focus: concentrating resources on a narrowed front
- Dynamics: riding waves of change

## Proximate Objectives
Test: "Can we accomplish this in 90 days with resources we have?" If not, break it down.
