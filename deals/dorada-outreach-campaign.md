### 1. Adivo Investments (Score 14) - FAMILY OFFICE VERSION

**To:** Aamir Aka (CEO) — `aamir@adivo.me` — +44 1494 674268

**Subject:** Multi-generational wellness asset in Costa Rica's Blue Zone

Dear Mr. Aka,

I'm reaching out regarding **Dorada**, a first-of-its-kind regenerative destination resort and residential community in one of the world's rare Blue Zone regions of Costa Rica.

Given Adivo Investments' focus on commercial real estate, hospitality, and property development, I believe Dorada aligns with your investment philosophy—particularly as a multi-generational legacy asset that combines:

- **300-acre protected bio-reserve** with panoramic ocean views
- **40 private estate homes** (1+ acre lots)
- **Longevity & Human Performance Center** offering personalized healthspan programs
- Fully off-grid with sustainable infrastructure
- **Recurring revenue** from wellness programs and memberships

Dorada is the vision of **Dr. Vincent Giampapa**, a globally recognized leader in anti-aging medicine and regenerative science. It's designed not as a hospitality project, but as a **permanent wellness ecosystem** for long-term ownership.

**Why for family offices:** Capital preservation with upside, intergenerational relevance, personal use optionality, and alignment with the $2.1T wellness economy (12.4% CAGR).

Would you be open to a brief call to discuss the opportunity? I'd be happy to share the full investor deck.

Best regards,
