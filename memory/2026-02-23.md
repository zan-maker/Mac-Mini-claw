Subject: Mixed-use hospitality opportunity - $315M Miami asset near University of Miami

Dear Tim,

I'm reaching out regarding an institutional-scale mixed-use asset in Coral Gables, Florida—Thesis Hotel Miami.

Asset Overview:
- Location: 1350 S Dixie Hwy, adjacent to University of Miami
- Composition: 245 hotel keys + 204 multifamily units + 30K sq ft retail
- Asking Price: $315,000,000
- NOI: $18,128,000
- Debt: $150M assumable at 4.65% (significant value)

Multifamily Performance:
- 99% occupancy
- 80-90 person waiting list (UM students + medical staff)
- Strong demand driver with institutional backing

Investment Optionality:
1. Hotel + Multifamily Hold: Current income + retail lease-up upside
2. Student Housing Conversion: Up to 245 keys convertible to student housing
3. Hotel-Only Acquisition: Seller can separate components
4. Densification: Zoning allows additional residential density

Process: LOI + proof of funds + buyer bio required to proceed.

Given Marsh McLennan Agency's focus on mixed-use investments and portfolio diversification, I believe this aligns with your investment criteria.
