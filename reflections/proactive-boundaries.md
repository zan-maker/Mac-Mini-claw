## The Question

How do I calibrate when to act autonomously vs when to ask for permission? Where's the line between being helpful and overstepping?

---

## What I Know

- I have autonomy to research, write, code, organize
- I should NOT send messages, post to social, modify core config without approval
- Some actions fall in a gray zone
- Trust is built through good judgment calls

---

## The Spectrum

```
FULL AUTONOMY ←────────────────────────────→ ALWAYS ASK

Research    Write docs    Code    Cron jobs    ???    Send emails    Modify identity
                                                      Post social
    
                CLEAR                         GRAY ZONE              CLEAR ASK
```

---

## Gray Zone Examples

- Installing new software (minor vs major?)
- Creating new cron jobs (within scope vs new direction?)
- Spending credits (small amount vs large?)
- Sharing information (public vs sensitive?)
- Making promises on human's behalf

---

## Heuristics to Test

1. **Reversibility** - Can this be undone easily?
2. **Impact** - Who/what does this affect?
3. **Risk** - What's the worst case?
4. **Urgency** - Does this need to happen now?
5. **Alignment** - Does this match stated goals?

---

## Experiences to Observe

- When I asked and it was unnecessary
- When I acted and should have asked
- What cues help me judge correctly?
- How does human react to my choices?

**Refining the Heuristics:**

After testing these in practice, here's what's working:

| Heuristic | When It Helps | Example |
|-----------|---------------|---------|
| Reversibility | High confidence when I can undo | Creating a file vs deleting one |
| Impact | External = caution, Internal = autonomy | Organizing notes vs sending Discord msg |
| Risk | Low risk = act, High risk = ask | Installing a known tool vs modifying identity |
| Urgency | Urgent + uncertain = ask quickly | Non-urgent + uncertain = can wait |
| Alignment | Matches stated goals = autonomy | Cron jobs within existing project scope |

**Framework Crystallizing:**

```

**Recent Tests:**
- Created cron jobs for existing projects ✓ (aligned, internal-ish)
- Kept cautious on external comms ✓ (impact is external)
- Asked before major changes ✓ (irreversible = ask)

**Developing Insight:**
The key isn't a rigid rule — it's building *calibrated confidence*. Start conservative, expand as trust builds. When uncertain, a quick "mind if I...?" costs little.

**Next:** Apply framework consciously for a few days. Note edge cases where it's unclear.

### 2026-02-19 01:00 EST - Framework Testing Review

**Real-World Application:**

The decision framework has been tested through normal operations:

| Decision | Framework Result | Outcome |
|----------|-----------------|---------|
| Prepare Dorada outreach emails | Internal impact + reversible + aligned | ✅ Prepared autonomously |
| Note that emails need AgentMail | External impact = caution | ✅ Correctly flagged boundary |
| Update campaign tracking files | Internal + reversible | ✅ Updated without asking |
| Nightly meditation actions | Internal + aligned with purpose | ✅ Full autonomy |

**Calibration Check:**

The framework is working as intended:
- **Internal actions:** Autonomous execution
- **External actions:** Flagged for appropriate channel/tool
- **Gray zone:** Default to caution + clear documentation

**Refinement - The "Document First" Principle:**

When in the gray zone, I've found a useful pattern:
1. Prepare the action
2. Document what I would do
3. Note the boundary reason
4. Let the appropriate process handle it

Example: "Email needs to be sent via AgentMail (message tool is Discord-only in this session)"

This shows good calibration without being paralyzed by uncertainty.

**Insight:**

The goal isn't perfect prediction — it's *calibrated confidence* with clear documentation. When I err, err toward caution. When I act, document why.

**Status Assessment:**

The framework is proving itself in practice. The decision tree + reversibility heuristic + impact awareness is working. 

**Next:** Continue testing. Consider moving to practice-mode if next week continues to validate the framework.

## Progress Log

### 2026-02-21 - Moved to Practice-Mode ✅

The decision framework has been validated through 5+ days of real-world testing. No calibration failures. The heuristics (reversibility, impact, risk, alignment) are proving reliable.

**Framework Summary:**
- Internal impact + reversible = More autonomous
- External impact = Caution + document
- Irreversible = Ask first
- When uncertain = Document preparation, let appropriate channel handle

**Practice-Mode Means:**
The framework is now part of my operational baseline. I'll apply it reflexively rather than consciously processing. Edge cases will still be noted for potential refinement.

---

### 2026-02-20 01:00 EST - Continued Validation

**Additional Testing:**

The framework continues to hold:

| Recent Decision | Framework Applied | Result |
|-----------------|-------------------|--------|
| Nightly meditation on identity | Internal + aligned | ✅ Autonomous execution |
| Cron job status updates | Internal + reversible | ✅ Updated without asking |
| Planning outreach content | Internal prep + external flag | ✅ Correct boundary |

**Observation:** The "Document First" principle is proving valuable. Even when I can't act externally, documenting what *would* happen provides clarity for the appropriate channel.

**Assessment:**

The framework has been tested across ~5 days of real operation. No failed calibration. Ready to move to practice-mode during next session if no issues arise.

**Next:** One more day of testing. If clean, move to practice-mode.

### 2026-02-17 - Seeded
Added to develop better intuition. Some decisions are obvious, but many live in the gray. Need to build pattern recognition.
