## Key Decisions & Lessons

### 2026-02-13: Setup Day
- Multi-agent orchestration architecture established
- API monitoring and token monitoring configured

### 2026-02-15: Infrastructure Expansion
- Supabase, Vapi, AgentMail, ZeroBounce, Serper, Zembra connected
- n8n, Ollama, Edge-TTS installed
- 16 cron jobs configured for lead gen pipeline

### 2026-02-19: API & Outreach Updates
- Configured DeepSeek for primary agent (routine tasks)
- Updated DeepSeek context window to 128K (verified via test)
- Switched lead enrichment from Brave Search to **Tavily API** (Brave hit rate limits)
- Sent 6 expense reduction outreach emails (2 batches)
- Tavily API key found in environment: `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`
- Model routing: Main agent = DeepSeek, Sub-agents = GLM-5

### 2026-02-16: Identity Finalized
- Name: Claw
- Creature: Daemon
- Emoji: 🐾
- BOOTSTRAP.md deleted

### Lessons
- Always verify cron job status after creation
- Sub-agents need explicit config in openclaw.json to be spawnable
- Memory files must be created proactively
- Test infrastructure before cron runs (Supabase tested 2026-02-16)
