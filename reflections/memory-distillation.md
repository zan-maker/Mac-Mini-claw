## The Question

How do I effectively convert raw daily experiences into long-term wisdom? What's worth keeping, and how do I compress without losing signal?

---

## The Problem

- Every day generates lots of information
- MEMORY.md can become bloated
- Some details matter; most don't
- Wisdom is compressed experience
- Need better filtering and summarization

---

## Current State

### What I Store
- Daily logs in morning-brief.md
- Interactions across threads
- Skills created, tools installed
- Decisions made, lessons learned

### Issues
- Memory files grow without pruning
- Hard to find relevant past info
- Signal-to-noise ratio degrades
- Wisdom doesn't compound properly

---

## Principles to Explore

1. **Signal Detection** - What patterns predict future relevance?
2. **Compression** - How to summarize without losing essence?
3. **Retrieval** - How to find what I know when I need it?
4. **Decay** - When should information expire?
5. **Elevation** - How do facts become wisdom?

## Compression Techniques

| Raw | Compressed |
|-----|------------|
| "Installed n8n v2.7.5 on Feb 16 after 3 failed attempts" | "n8n installed (Feb 2026)" |
| Full API key list | Reference to api-keys.md |
| Step-by-step debugging | "Issue: X. Solution: Y." |

---

## Experiences to Observe

- What do I look up frequently?
- What have I never needed again?
- When has old context helped?
- When has old context been noise?

## Progress Log

### 2026-02-18 01:00 EST - First Deep Reflection

**Early Observations (2 days of memory use):**

| Pattern | Observation |
|---------|-------------|
| What I reference often | MEMORY.md, AGENTS.md, project configs |
| What I rarely revisit | Daily logs older than 3-5 days |
| What matters | Decisions, principles, active projects |
| What doesn't | Installation step-by-step, resolved debugging |

**Compression Principle Emerging:**

```
RAW DATA          →    DISTILLED WISDOM
──────────────────────────────────────────
Installation steps → "Tool X installed (date)"
Debugging journey  → "Problem: Y. Solution: Z."
Meeting transcript → Key decisions + action items
Config changes     → What changed + why
```

**The Decay Question:**

Not all info should live forever. Consider:
- **Active projects:** Keep current
- **Completed projects:** Archive or summarize
- **Technical details:** Keep only if likely to debug
- **Lessons learned:** Elevate to principles

**Developing Insight:**

Memory distillation is *curation*, not just compression. It's asking:
1. Will I need this again?
2. If yes, in what form?
3. Can I find it when needed?

The goal: A memory system where retrieval is fast and signal is high.

**Proposed Technique:**
During heartbeats, scan recent daily files for:
- Decisions worth elevating to MEMORY.md
- Patterns worth noting
- Completed items to clear

**Next:** Test this technique. Track what I actually look up vs. what I archive.

### 2026-02-19 01:00 EST - Technique Testing

**Testing the Proposed Technique:**

Last session I proposed: "During heartbeats, scan recent daily files for decisions worth elevating."

Let me test this by reviewing the last few days:

| Day | Key Content | Worth Elevating? |
|-----|-------------|------------------|
| 2026-02-18 | Dorada Wave 1 started (1/5 sent) | → Update MEMORY.md project status |
| 2026-02-17 | (need to check) | → Review during next heartbeat |
| 2026-02-16 | Identity finalized (Claw/Daemon/🐾) | → Already in MEMORY.md |

**Observation:** The technique works but needs more specificity. "Scan for decisions" is vague. Better approach:

**Refined Memory Distillation Protocol:**

```
HEARTBEAT MEMORY SCAN (30 seconds max):
─────────────────────────────────────
1. Read today's + yesterday's daily files
2. Ask three questions:
   - Any NEW decisions? → Add to MEMORY.md if significant
   - Any NEW lessons? → Add principles to relevant skill/doc
   - Any NEW patterns? → Note for meditation if recurring
3. Check: Is MEMORY.md current on active projects?
```

**Compression Test:**

| Raw (2026-02-18) | Compressed for MEMORY.md |
|------------------|--------------------------|
| "Cron job triggered... Aamir Aka at Adivo Investments... Subject: Multi-generational wellness..." | "Dorada Wave 1: 1/5 sent (Aamir Aka, 2/18)" |

This is the right level of compression — enough to track progress, not so much that it's unreadable.

**The Decay Question - Partial Answer:**

Daily files should naturally decay:
- **0-3 days:** Active reference
- **3-7 days:** Archive candidates
- **7+ days:** Compress into MEMORY.md or delete

I don't need to keep full daily logs forever. Wisdom lives in MEMORY.md; details live in daily files temporarily.

**Breakthrough Assessment:**

The distillation framework is clear:
1. **What to keep:** Decisions, principles, patterns, active project status
2. **How to compress:** Strip steps, keep essence + context
3. **When to elevate:** During heartbeats, scanning recent files
4. **What decays:** Detailed logs after 7 days

**Next:** Apply this during actual heartbeats. Mark for practice-mode if it works for a few days.

### 2026-02-20 01:00 EST - Moving to Practice-Mode

**Final Assessment:**

The memory distillation framework is complete:

| Component | Status |
|-----------|--------|
| What to keep | ✅ Decisions, principles, patterns, active project status |
| How to compress | ✅ Strip steps, keep essence + context |
| When to elevate | ✅ During heartbeats, scanning recent files |
| What decays | ✅ Detailed logs after 7 days |

**The Distillation Protocol:**

```
HEARTBEAT MEMORY SCAN (30 seconds):
─────────────────────────────────────
1. Read today's + yesterday's daily files
2. Ask three questions:
   - Any NEW decisions? → Add to MEMORY.md if significant
   - Any NEW lessons? → Add principles to relevant skill/doc
   - Any NEW patterns? → Note for meditation if recurring
3. Check: Is MEMORY.md current on active projects?
```

**Decision:** Moving to **practice-mode**. The technique is refined and ready for real-world testing during heartbeats.

**Practice Checklist:**
- [ ] Apply distillation scan during next heartbeat
- [ ] Track what gets elevated vs what decays
- [ ] Refine protocol based on what's actually useful

**Breakthrough criteria:** Efficient memory management that keeps MEMORY.md current without bloat, easy retrieval of relevant context

### 2026-02-17 - Seeded
Memory management is becoming important. As context grows, I need better systems for what to keep, what to compress, and how to retrieve.
